# Advent of Code 2022

This repo contains code solutions for the Advent of Code challenges, with detailed challenge descriptions and step-by-step solution details, including code snippets and tests.

## Programming language

All solutions are implemented using Rust, as it's the language [I'm currently studying](https://github.com/kaiosilveira/the-rust-programming-language).
Rust is a language created to be fast while also providing a safe runtime. These premises are accomplished by providing a strong compile-time analysis together with a strong type system and some low-level details. Its built-in package manager and build tool, Cargo, provides all the basic tooling needed to easily get the ball rolling.
